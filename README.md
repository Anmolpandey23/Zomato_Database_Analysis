# Zomato Database Analysis

# Project Overview

This project focuses on performing an analysis of the Zomato restaurant database. The dataset includes various information such as restaurant names, locations, cuisines, user reviews, ratings, and more. The goal of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights about the food industry, including trends in restaurant ratings, popular cuisines, location-based preferences, and more.

# Dataset Description

The Zomato dataset contains the following key columns:

- Restaurant Name: Name of the restaurant.
- Average Cost for Two: The average cost of a meal for two people at the restaurant.
- Rating: The average rating given by users to the restaurant.
- Votes: The number of user votes for the restaurant.
- Book Table: A column indicating whether the restaurant allows customers to book tables online.
- Orders: Whether the restaurant offers online ordering or if it is for in-restaurant dining only.

# Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis are to:

- Evaluate the relationship between restaurant cost and rating: Investigate if higher-priced restaurants tend to have higher ratings, and vice versa.
- Analyze the impact of user votes on restaurant ratings: Does a higher number of votes correlate with a higher or lower rating for restaurants?
- Explore the correlation between table booking options and restaurant ratings: Do restaurants that offer online table bookings have better ratings?
- Analyze the distribution of restaurant types based on orders: Determine whether online orders or in-restaurant dining dominate, and how this correlates with ratings and cost.
- Identify trends in restaurant popularity: What patterns can be identified based on the number of votes, ratings, and the availability of online ordering or table bookings?

# Tools & Libraries

- Python: The analysis is conducted using Python.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and visualization.

# Analysis and Visualizations

In this project, you will find the following analyses and visualizations:

- Cost vs. Rating: A scatter plot to analyze the relationship between average cost for two and restaurant ratings.
- Votes vs. Rating: A chart showing how the number of user votes impacts the restaurant rating.
- Table Booking vs. Rating: A bar chart that examines the difference in ratings for restaurants that offer table booking online vs. those that donâ€™t.
- Orders and Ratings Distribution: A comparison of ratings for restaurants that offer online orders vs. those that only offer in-restaurant dining.
- Restaurant Popularity: A heatmap or bar chart showing the number of votes per restaurant in relation to average cost and ratings.

# Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into customer preferences and restaurant performance. By evaluating the relationship between key factors like cost, rating, and user votes, as well as understanding the role of features like online ordering and table booking, restaurant owners can make data-driven decisions to improve their offerings and customer satisfaction.
